# Wes Kroesbergen

I solve problems with technology. My approach is to understand root principles first, then build solutions from there—which often means getting hands-on with code.

## What I Do

**Cloud & Identity Architecture** — Deep expertise in Azure (Functions, Web Apps), Active Directory, Entra ID, and identity protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect). I design secure, scalable access management solutions.

**Application Development** — Building solutions with .NET, Blazor, Swift, and Flutter, backed by Firebase and Azure services.

**DevOps & Integration** — CI/CD pipelines, Azure DevOps, Stripe payment integrations, and UI/UX design across web and mobile platforms.

## Selected Projects

- **SIMON** — AI-powered Teams chatbot for IT Service Desk teams managing Microsoft Cloud services
- **MovoSuite** — Self-service automation tools for Microsoft Intune, enabling teacher app deployments
- **Resource Scheduler for Azure** — Cost optimization and resource management tooling
- **Flashcards** — Firebase/Flutter app for certification exam prep
- **Quiz App** — Flutter app for security certification prep (CISSP, CISM) with analytics and subscription support
